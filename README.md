Shortcomings
I'm aware of the following shortcomings listed below:

Performance 🚀


Security 🔒


Styling 🎨
***Create theme templates***

Data management 🗄
Automatic database cleanups are currently missing (e.g. when a project or user is deleted).

Accessibility ♿
No extra efforts have been put into making this project more accessible. For a production-ready app, adding aria roles and keyboard support would go a long way towards making the app more accessible.
